Infection Map - Knowledge from the crowds and the sky
=====================================================

Infection Map (IM) is a web service for collecting and studying the evolution of diseases.

IM relies on two mechanisms:

  * Collecting disease information directly from people, by making it easy to report a disease occurrence.
  * Linking collected data with satellite data on weather conditions related to the disease (e.g. precipitations).

Status
------

  * IM can collect disease information.
  * Satellite data is still in the works at this point. Data from [Shizuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Change_Observation_Mission) is the target for [ISAC 2015](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/).
  * Focus on types of influenza and Dengue fever.
